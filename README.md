This script is a cage fight challenge, you vs 6 people. It costs $2500 to play and if you finish them all then you'll win $10k.

Each opponent is stronger and has more health. The player has a stamina bar that goes down when punching, kicking, or dodging. If the bar is empty then you can't do any of these actions and you need to wait for it to regenerate.

This resource can be used with any framework. And the price to play and the winning money is configurable.
